#The mean of 40 numbers is 38. Later on, I detected that I misread the number 56 as 36. Find the correct mean of given numbers.

mean1 = 38
wrong_number=36
correct_number=56
total_number=40
#sum of 40 numbers
print("the sum of 40 number: ",sum)

#correct sum of these numbers
num2=sum-((wrong_number)-(correct_number))
print("sum-((wrong_number)-(correct_number)): ",num2)

#the correct mean
mean2=num2/total_number
print(mean2)
