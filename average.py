#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?


#storing values

tree1 = 98
tree2 = 94
tree3 = 41
tree4 = 96
tree5 = 11

#finding the total of trees

sum = tree1+tree2+tree3+tree4+tree5

print("the sum of all the 5 trees is:", sum)

#finding the average of trees

average = sum/5

print("The average of all the trees is:", average )
